Assume that both layouts were created using a similar CSS grid. What would you do to make layout b look like a? Clearly state any assumptions you make about the layout.

If you did not position “Next Day Shipping” absolutely to the right, why not? 

solution1: with the help of direct class "right-align" we can perform the above task but only when we are using material css. 
Solution2: if we are using normal css grid we can do it by simply use of "text-align right" on 3rd coloumn (div).

What is the difference between how Flexbox and CSS Grid calculate item/container size?

Grid: Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and coloumns
Grid: CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality to automatically adjust columns or rows.
Grid:CSS Grid also makes it possible to create responsive layouts without using media queries. 


Flex: The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.:Flexbox only deals with either columns or rows.
Flex: Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks.
Flex: Flexbox layout items along either the horizontal or the vertical axis, so you have to decide whether you want a row-based or a column-based layout.
Flex: A flex layout can also wrap in multiple rows or columns and flexbox treats each row or column as a separate entity, based on its content and the available space.
