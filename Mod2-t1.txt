        MAp>A Map does not contain any keys by default. It only contains what is explicitly put into it.

        Object>An Object has a prototype, so it contains default keys that could collide with your own keys if you're not careful.


key Types -
         MAp - A Map's keys can be any value (including functions, objects, or any primitive). 

        Object-The keys of an Object must be either a String or a Symbol.

key order-
         Map-The keys in Map are ordered in a simple, straightforward way: A Map object iterates entries, keys, and values in the order of entry insertion.
         Object- This is not true in case of objects.


size -  
   MAp -The number of items in a Map is easily retrieved from its size property.
   Object -The number of items in an Object must be determined manually.
   


Iteration-

   map-A Map is an iterable, so it can be directly iterated.
   Object- Object does not implement an iteration protocol, and so objects are not directly iterable using the JavaScript for...of statement (by default).
