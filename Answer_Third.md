# Difference between CSS-Grid and Flex-Box

1. CSS FlexBox used for one dimentional either a row or a column kind of design. But but when it comes to Grid, it was designed for 2 dimentional design purposes.

2. When it comes to one dimentional designe we always need to give the preference to flex box because it gives us proper control over wrapping elements in box kind of model and also flexbox design is used in most case on children but grid is mostly defined on parent element.

3. we can think of grid as two dimensional in that case we can declare the sizing of rows and columns and then explicitly place things into both rows and columns as we choose.

4. Grid is better at overlapping rather then flexBox because flex box relies on traditional stuffs like negative margins and transforms or absolute positioningin order to breakout of flex behaviour.
