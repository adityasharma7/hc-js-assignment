Task 2: Find out about the most popular open-source JavaScript frameworks. (At least 5)

1. React
React is the leader in the JavaScript world, created and maintained by Facebook, is the most influential JavaScript-based Web library. React has earned massive popularity within a short span and over 2 million websites like Facebook, Instagram, Yahoo, Netflix, Dropbox, etc are using React for building interactive and complex UI. It uses a reactive approach for front-end web development and takes care of the dynamic User Interface of the web pages with high incoming traffic. It is Component-based and component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates to pass rich data through your app. React can be your first choice for creating an awesome front end for the following features:

Declarative views help to debug faster. Create interactive UI Design simple views for each state in your application and efficiently update and render just the right components using React.
Component-Based approach helps to manage each encapsulated component’s state, to design complex UIs.The whole web page divided into a small self-contained module known as a component.
React JSX, a markup language makes writing React components which is a fusion of HTML into JavaScript.
Unidirectional data flow only supports downstream or upstream data flow which makes the logic more predictable and easier to understand.
Virtual DOM is a representation of a DOM object which creates a virtual copy of the original DOM. In React every DOM object has a corresponding virtual DOM for one-way data binding to quickly manipulate the virtual DOM rather than updating the original DOM.
LOWA or Learn Once, Write Anywhere helps you to develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
React Native, a custom renderer for React uses native components instead of web components. React along with native platform capabilities used to develop applications for Android, iOS.

2.  Angular
 A JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework Angular is one of the most powerful, efficient, open-source framework which is the part of MEAN stack. It is also the main rival of React, developed, and maintained by Google. AngularJs is very useful for developing a Single Page Application (SPA). This development framework is very popular for helping developers to combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS. It loved by millions for its productivity and scalable and over one million websites like google.com, youtube.com, etc. are using Angular for its awesome tools, speed, and performance.

MVC architecture or Model-View-Controller architecture is one of the most essential features of AngularJS, which is divided into three elements, i.e., the Model, View, and Controller to simplify both the development and the testing of single-page applications.
SPEED & PERFORMANCE of Angular is uncomparable. Angular helps to develop progressive modern web apps with high performance, offline mode, and zero-step installation.
Two-way binding is a very useful feature of Angular which helps to build a link between Model and View, in which the View reflects changes made in the Model and vice-versa.
Incredible Tools of Angular are very useful to increase your productivity focus on building amazing apps.  Command-line tools help to build, test, then instantly deploy. use simple and powerful template syntax to create UI views and  Get intelligent code completion, instant errors, and other feedback in almost every IDEs.
HTML UI leads to a more organized and simplistic UI. HTML, a common and declarative language with elementary tags that are very easy to understand than the complicated Javascript code. So, If you’re looking for a quick, simple, and easy solution, then this is it.

3. Vue.js
It is an open-source Progressive JavaScript Framework for building creative UI and high-end single-page Web applications.  Vue is designed to be incrementally adoptable which gives easy integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries. Vue supports declarative rendering using template syntax to provide data to the DOM and it is an excellent framework for beginners. Vue has quickly risen to prominence in the Web development community and giving an extreme challenge to both Angular and React. Big companies like Grammarly, Adobe, GitLab, StackOverflow, PlayStation, etc. are relying on Vue for their websites UI and almost over 671,000 websites that using  Vue. js in 2020.

Versatile: provides an adoptable ecosystem to scale between a library and a framework.
Progressive:  it gives you the power to plug into any web app that is running on any other framework, without making any changes.
Beginner-friendly:  Vue is the best framework to start building web applications if you already know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Reactive:  it is a fast and responsive framework which takes the user input, regardless of network speed or latency,
Small in size: Does size matter? -Of course, One of the greatest advantages of Vue.js is its size which is surprizingly18–21KB.
Complexity: It is super simple to use with quality documentation support. You can build simple applications very easily using Vue.

4. Meteor
Meteor is an open-source javascript framework written using NodeJS to develop simple, efficient, and scalable javascript applications for web, mobile, and desktop. This framework is a perfect full-stack solution that covers almost all the significant portion of the software development including back-end development, management of the database, business logic, and even rendering of the front-end. It allows rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform code. It helps in faster development with relatively less code. It’s rapidly gaining popularity in the market with over 15,00 websites like Qualcomm, Honeywell, rocket. chat, mtv.com, meteofrance.com are using Meteor.

Full-stack: it offers a full-stack solution for developing and deploying web applications and offers a bundle of built-in features, such as reactive templates, automatic CSS, as well as client-side technologies, including templates, helpers, and events.
Smart packages: it has almost 14,177 no smart packages which make your development work very easy. You can easily add these packages just with a few keystrokes in the terminal.
Integration: Integrate with React, Angular, Vue, MongoDB, or any popular frameworks easily to focus only on building features instead of wiring disparate components together yourself.
Efficient-Code: leverage the power of JavaScript with less code length and complexity which saves a lot of production time of developers. Accomplish in 10 lines what would take 1,000 lines.
Real-time: It is the perfect solution for building real-time applications. And any changes to documents save instantly, No need to refresh the page to see updates all of the application’s layers from the database to template update automatically.

5. EmberJs
It is an open-source, productive JavaScript framework that lets developers build scalable modern web applications that includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. Ember was named the best of client-side JavaScript frameworks, leaving behind its main competitors, React and AngularJS and over 40000 websites including Microsoft, Nasa.Gov, Apple, LinkedIn, etc are using ember. Ember supports two-way data binding and hence, establishes a reliable platform for handling the complicated User Interfaces but the best component is its direction line interface apparatus which helps front-end designers be profoundly profitable and lets them complete activities on schedule. 

Code generators: Ember CLI provides code generators to create new entities and put the necessary files in the right place, every time. The built-in environment provides fast rebuilds, auto-reload, etc.
 Support: It has a huge online community with regular updates and wide appliance which guarantee ultimate experience right out of the box.
Template: allows developers to use less code with lots of useful features possible in Ember, like Components, Outlets, and Expressions.
Provides: instance initializers and offers routes that are used for managing the URL.
Easy-debug: it provides the Ember Inspector tool for debugging with no overhead.
According to popular and reliable websites like GitHub, StackOverflow, NPM Trends, Google Trends, etc, these 5 JavaScript frameworks are the most popular and useful among developers but there are also some brilliant JavaScript frameworks which are gaining popularity day by day. NodeJs, BackboneJS, ExpressJs, Next Js, Svelte, Polymer, Aurelia are some honorable Mention for the top popular JavaScript framework. You can try these also depending upon your project requirements. Please note, Node JS is not a framework but a run time development platform for server-side execution of JavaScript code.
