# Difference Between Normal Function and Arrow Function

When it comes to "Hoisting" this consept makes a difference between normal function and arrow function.

1. Arrow function with any of the keywords like var const and let are not hoisted but normal functions are.

2. The value of "This" inside of an arrow function is basically what it's value would have been outside of arrow function.
   <!-- What it basically mean that the value of this keyword in arrow function in bound to it's parrent element  -->

   But in normal function it is not like that.

3. We can not use new keyword inside of arrow function but this can be done with the help of normal function
