# Difference Between Maps and Objects in JavaScript

1. In javascript map is having key type of primitive, object, or a function But objects can only contain key type of string.

2. Map is fully iterable in javascript but objects can not iterarted directly in javascript, for iterating over an object we need to first store keys of object in an array then we will go threw this object with the help of array.

3. In javascript there are method available to get the size of the map but for objects there is any method is not available in javascript for getting the size of object we will follow the same process as like array.

4. As we know map is a pure hashtable so there are not any kind of method to convert map in json table but we can do this with the help of our own json parser. And Object helps us in this with the help of out of the box support of Json String.
