Sir This answer can warry on our choise if we want to build mobile first application then we will first design our application's design for and then we will put in media query min-width = something and then design our as per desktop.

But if we want to build our application with priority for web layout then first of all we design the application as per desktop layout after that we will have to put max-width = something and then we will design our application for mobile layout.
