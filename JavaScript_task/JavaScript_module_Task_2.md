Find out about the most popular open-source JavaScript frameworks. (At least 5)


React.js
 It (also known as ReactJS or React) is an open-source, front-end JavaScript library. It was created in 2013 by Jordan Walke, who works at Facebook as a software engineer.

* Plenty of reusable components to build business logic
* Ease of integration with front-end and back-end
* Unidirectional data flow with flux controls
* SEO-friendly JavaScript framework.
* Huge support community.

Anguler:
Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner. 

* Component-based architecture
* High-class server performance
* Two-way data binding 
* A rich collection of third-party integrations
* A massive community of developers

Svelte:
it  is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

* Component-based model pattern
* Easy to use, learn, and understand
* One of the most small-sized builds 
* High-speed rendering and top-notch performance
* Supports both client and server-side rendering

Node_js:
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

* Easy to use and integrate with other applications
* Ability to scale up as per the requirements
* Asynchronous and non-blocking thread execution
* Support for handling plenty of simultaneous connection
* Fast processing and event-based model

Express JS:
it is an open-source and minimalistic back-end JavaScript framework based on Node.js that developers use to build complex APIs and web applications. The framework has gained massive popularity in recent years, and due to that, it has become the first choice when using the MEAN or MERN stack. The USP of Express JS is its rapid server-side coding ability, and it enables web application developers to complete any complex task within a matter of minutes.

* Active community support
* Rich set of documentation
* Powerful routing mechanism
* Seamless connectivity with all databases
* Accelerates web app development process
