QUESTION
You are writing a responsive layout for a website that has dramatically different layouts for mobile and desktop. Which of the following media queries would you use and why?
@media (max-width: ... @media (min-width: ...


ANSWER
For Mobile Devices 
I will use @media-screen and (max-width: XXXpx)
This is becuase max-width alllow us to set max width of the screen or we can say that if we set max-width: 728px
& we specify some CSS inside it, it will apply that CSS if and only if max-width of screen is less than equal to 728px
so by this we can set some CSS for Mobile Devices or Tablet Devices

For Desktop Devices
I will use min-width as it will set some min-width i.e if we specify some CSS inside min-width, that CSS will get applied 
if any only if screen size is greater or equal to that width.
As we know desktop screens are bigger so we can specify some min-width of screen and give some CSS so if min-width of screen is greater than that width,
apply that CSS.
