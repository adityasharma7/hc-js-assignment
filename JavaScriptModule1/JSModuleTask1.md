Task 1 : Find out about the most popular JavaScript frameworks. (At least 5)
Answer:
1. ReactJs
The current leader in the JavaScript UI framework field is React. At first, Facebook developers started working on it to simplify their work. The application called Facebook Ads was growing extremely fast, which meant complicated management and support. As a result, the team started building a library to help them with efficiency. They had an early prototype before 2011 and, two years later, the library was open-source and available to the public. A lot of business giants are currently using it: AirBNB, PayPal, Netflix, etc. 

React is based on a reusable component. Simply put, these are code blocks that can be classified as either classes or functions. Each component represents a specific part of a page, such as a logo, a button, or an input box. The parameters they use are called props, which stands for properties. Speaking of syntax, most developers agree that React is easy to learn when you already know JavaScript.

React uses JSX, an XML syntax that combines JavaScript and HTML. It’s not a JavaScript template; it’s full-on JavaScript. Some new developers might find JSX a bit confusing at first. After working with it for a while, however, you will understand how beneficial it is.  React has a lot to do with it, and it’s a library that you should look out for if you’re in front-end web development.

2. Angular
Angular is one of the most powerful and open-source JavaScript frameworks. Google operates this framework and is designed to use it to develop a Single Page Application (SPA). This development framework is known primarily because it gives developers the best conditions to combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS. Over half a million websites, such as google.com, youtube.com, etc., use Angular. 

One of the factors it is known to be so reliable is the support of Google. It is also the JavaScript UI framework of choice for Google app developers. Angular has a component-based structure, just like React. You can manipulate, nest, and reuse them as you need them. You will need to use TypeScript to write an application to Angular. It’s a JavaScript superset that uses the same syntax but also supports static typing and classes. In TypeScript, you get access modifiers, enums, generics, hybrid types, and more. Generally speaking, Angular is a fantastic platform to look at if you’re a new dev.

3.  Vue.js
Vue is an open-source JavaScript framework for creating a creative UI. The integration with Vue in projects using other JavaScript libraries is simplified because it is designed to be adaptable. More than 36,000 websites are currently using Vue. Companies like Stackoverflow, PlayStation, etc. rely on Vue for their UI websites. 

Vue.js is also quite simple to learn: you just need all the background knowledge you need is JavaScript and HTML. Another strength of Vue.js is its official command-line interface (CLI). It is basic tooling that speeds up development by offering a ton of plugins, presets, instant prototyping, and an interactive project scaffolding tool.   Some of its features include components, templates, transitions, and two-way data binding, as well as a reactivity focus. Reactivity occurs when you change or update any of the JavaScript objects in Vue. Vue.js uses something called the Shadow DOM that makes the page rendering fast.

4.   Ember.js
Ember.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that was originally released by Yehuda Katz in 2011. It was initially known as SproutCore 2.0 before it became known as Ember.js. Work on the Ember framework started in 2011 and version 1.0 was released two years later. Instead of one company supporting the project, Ember has many supporters who are usually users of the framework, such as LinkedIn and Yahoo.

It is also highly scalable and can be used for large projects. Apple Music, which has more than 60 million subscribers worldwide, was built on Ember. If you want to see how you can – there’s a tool called the Ember Inspector that allows you to take a closer look at Ember ‘s projects online.

Ember features an excellent build tool, borrowed from many other SPA frameworks, called Ember CLI. This build tool has everything you need to get started. Do you need a router? It’s built-in there. Need to be tested? It’s built-in, too. Do you need to work with back-end data? There’s data on Ember. Ember.js follows many of the same principles that Ruby has on the Rails. It’s highly thought-out, flexible, and prefers convention over configuration. Ember.js is just getting better, and I would highly recommend it to you.

5. Backbone.js
It’s one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks. It can be used to create a single page application. The development of this framework involves the idea that all server-side functions must flow through an API, which would help to achieve complex functionality by writing less code.

BackboneJS is a lightweight JavaScript library that enables client-side applications running in a web browser to be developed and structured. Unlike other frameworks, Backbone puts the developer in charge of selecting the right tool that works best for a given project. More than half a million websites are currently using Backbone, including tumblr.com, espn.com, soundcloud.com, and many more.
